## Known Issues

The following issues need to be addressed:

1. **OAuth2 Client ID Configuration**
   - Issue: The extension requires a valid OAuth2 client ID
   - Status: Pending
   - Solution: Replace the placeholder `${CLIENT_ID}` in manifest.json with a real OAuth2 client ID from Google Cloud Platform

2. **Audio Playback Restrictions**
   - Issue: Some browsers restrict audio playback without user interaction
   - Status: Mitigated
   - Solution: Added fallback mechanisms to start audio after user interaction

3. **WebGL Compatibility**
   - Issue: The new notification design uses WebGL for visual effects
   - Status: Mitigated
   - Solution: Added CSS fallbacks for browsers that don't support WebGL

4. **Background Script Window Positioning**
   - Issue: Background scripts cannot access window.screen properties
   - Status: Fixed
   - Solution: Added dynamic screen size detection using chrome.system.display API with fallback to Full HD dimensions

5. **Chrome Windows API Compatibility**
   - Issue: Some properties used in chrome.windows.create() are not supported
   - Status: Fixed
   - Solution: Removed unsupported properties (titlePreface, setSelfAsOpener) from the options object

6. **Storage Limitations for Custom Ringtones**
   - Issue: Chrome storage has a 5MB limit which could be reached with many custom ringtones
   - Status: Mitigated
   - Solution: Implemented a cleanup mechanism to remove older custom ringtones when the limit is approached

7. **Early Notification Timing**
   - Issue: Early notifications require precise timing
   - Status: Implemented
   - Solution: Added minute-based detection system with tracking to prevent duplicate notifications

## Next Milestone

The next milestone is to test the extension with a valid Google Cloud Platform OAuth2 client ID and verify the complete workflow from authentication to meeting notification.

**Testing Steps:**
1. Replace `${CLIENT_ID}` in manifest.json with a valid OAuth2 client ID
2. Load the extension in Chrome
3. Authenticate with Google Calendar
4. Verify that upcoming meetings are detected
5. Test notification appearance and audio playback
6. Verify Join/Decline functionality
7. Test the new notification design across different browsers
8. Test ringtone selection and custom uploads
9. Test early notifications at different time intervals
10. Verify snooze functionality works correctly
