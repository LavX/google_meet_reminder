### April 2, 2025 - UX Improvements

1. **Modified Meeting Join Behavior**
   - Changed the "Join" button functionality to open Google Meet in a new window instead of a new tab
   - Updated the `joinMeeting()` function in `background.js` to use `chrome.windows.create()` instead of `chrome.tabs.create()`

   - Removed the `setTimeout()` code in `notification.js` that added the "urgent" class
   - Removed the shake animation and `.urgent` class definitions from `notification.css`

   - Verify snooze functionality works correctly with different durations
   - Ensure that all functionality continues to work as expected

3. **Potential Future Improvements**
   - Consider adding more customization options for notification behavior
   - Explore options for calendar integration improvements

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **User Experience Focus**
   - The extension should be helpful without being intrusive or annoying
   - Notifications should be noticeable but not distracting
   - Meeting join process should be streamlined and efficient
   - Visual design should be modern and aesthetically pleasing
   - Audio alerts should be customizable to user preferences

2. **Browser Window Management**
   - Using a new window for meetings helps users separate their meeting context from their browsing context
   - This approach works well for users who prefer to have meetings in dedicated windows

3. **Notification Design**
   - Removed shaking animation while keeping the pulsing effect
   - Moving to a completely new design with black background, aurora effect, and orb buttons
   - This provides a balance between drawing attention and not being overly distracting
   - Audio alerts are still used as the primary attention-getting mechanism
   - The new design aims to make notifications more visually appealing while maintaining functionality

4. **Ringtone Management**
   - Storing custom ringtones as data URLs in chrome.storage.local
   - Limiting custom uploads to 2MB to manage storage space
   - Removing "Grace UX" prefix from ringtone names for cleaner display
   - Implementing a grid layout for ringtone selection to make browsing easier
   - Adding cleanup mechanism for old custom ringtones to manage storage limits

5. **Snooze and Early Notification Management**
   - Storing snooze preferences and early notification settings in chrome.storage.local
   - Implementing a tracking system to prevent duplicate early notifications
   - Using customizable durations for snooze functionality to improve user experience
   - Adding meeting agenda display to early notifications for better context
