# Google Meet Reminder Extension - Active Context

## Current Focus

**Last Updated:** April 2, 2025

The current focus is on improving the user experience of the Google Meet Reminder extension by addressing specific usability issues:

1. Making the "Join" button open Google Meet in a new window instead of a new tab
2. Removing the shaking animation from notifications as it was found to be annoying
3. Redesigning the notification window with a more modern and visually appealing design

## Recent Changes

### April 2, 2025 - Notification Window Improvements

1. **Improved Notification Window Display**
   - Increased notification window size to 660x550 pixels for better visibility
   - Added dynamic screen size detection using chrome.system.display API
   - Added fallback to Full HD (1920x1080) dimensions if API is unavailable
   - Minimized the title bar by using a blank title and CSS techniques
   - Increased font sizes and element dimensions for better readability
   - Made the window draggable while keeping buttons clickable

2. **Fixed Test Notification Feature**
   - Fixed error with window.screen not being available in background script
   - Removed unsupported properties from chrome.windows.create() options
   - Ensured test notification works properly with the new design

### April 2, 2025 - Test Notification Feature

1. **Added Test Notification Feature**
   - Added a "Test Notification" button to the popup UI that appears when the user is authenticated
   - Implemented a handler in popup.js to send a test notification request to the background script
   - Added a new message handler in background.js to create and display a test notification
   - This feature allows users to test the notification system without waiting for an actual meeting



### April 2, 2025 - UX Improvements

1. **Modified Meeting Join Behavior**
   - Changed the "Join" button functionality to open Google Meet in a new window instead of a new tab
   - Updated the `joinMeeting()` function in `background.js` to use `chrome.windows.create()` instead of `chrome.tabs.create()`
   - This provides a better user experience by giving the meeting its own dedicated window

2. **Removed Shaking Animation**
   - Removed the shaking animation from notifications as it was reported to be annoying
   - Removed the `setTimeout()` code in `notification.js` that added the "urgent" class
   - Removed the shake animation and `.urgent` class definitions from `notification.css`
   - The notification still uses the pulsing effect which is less distracting but still draws attention

## Next Steps

1. **Notification Window Redesign**
   - Implement a complete redesign of the notification window with:
     - Black background with aurora effect (similar to https://www.reactbits.dev/backgrounds/aurora)
     - Meeting data (title and time) displayed above an orb
     - Orb element (similar to https://www.reactbits.dev/backgrounds/orb) as the main join button
     - A red reject button below the orb
   - Implementation plan includes:
     - Structure changes: New HTML layout, rebuilt CSS
     - WebGL implementation: Aurora background and orb elements
     - JavaScript functionality: Maintain core functionality while adding new visual effects
     - Testing on different browsers and screen sizes

2. **Testing**
   - Test the modified "Join" button functionality to ensure it correctly opens Google Meet in a new window
   - Verify that notifications no longer shake after 5 seconds
   - Test the new notification design across different browsers and screen sizes
   - Ensure that all other functionality continues to work as expected

3. **Potential Future Improvements**
   - Consider adding user preferences to customize notification behavior
   - Explore options for more subtle notification styles
   - Add ability to snooze notifications for a specific time period

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **User Experience Focus**
   - The extension should be helpful without being intrusive or annoying
   - Notifications should be noticeable but not distracting
   - Meeting join process should be streamlined and efficient
   - Visual design should be modern and aesthetically pleasing

2. **Browser Window Management**
   - Using a new window for meetings helps users separate their meeting context from their browsing context
   - This approach works well for users who prefer to have meetings in dedicated windows

3. **Notification Design**
   - Removed shaking animation while keeping the pulsing effect
   - Moving to a completely new design with black background, aurora effect, and orb buttons
   - This provides a balance between drawing attention and not being overly distracting
   - Audio alerts are still used as the primary attention-getting mechanism
   - The new design aims to make notifications more visually appealing while maintaining functionality
